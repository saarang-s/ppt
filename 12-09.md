### Predicate
#### Forall
- A predicate on nat is just a function from nat -> Prop 

    P : nat -> Prop

    P x = x is a prime number : Prop.

A = forall x Px : Prop


To prove forall x Px
I have to demonstrate a element  
pf : forall x Px .

forall x Px is the family of dependetly typed functions from nat 

$\Pi_{x:nat} $ Px.

#### Exists

$\exists x Px $

```Coq
Inductive ex (A:Type) (P: A-> Prop) : Prop :=
        ex_intro forall a:A, P a : ex A P .
```
- conj itself is polymorphic becuase A B can by anything of type Prop.

- Learn about *forall* and *exits*.
