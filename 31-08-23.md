#### in last class we saw.
- Every term has a type.
- Hierarchy of types.

```coq
True : Prop
Flase : Prop

x : True (*makes sense as True is a type*)
x : true (*does not makes sense as True is a type*)
```
The inductive proof of True
```coq
Print True.
```

Output:
```coq
Inductive True : Prop :=  I : True.
```

The inductive proof of False

```coq
Print False.
```

Output

```coq
Inductive False : Prop :=  .
```

#### Definition : and of two propositions
```coq
Inductive and (P: Prop)(Q:Prop) : Prop := conj : P->Q-> and PQ.
```
Type of and
```coq
and
     : Prop -> Prop -> Prop
```

Type of conj

```coq
conj
     : forall A B : Prop,
       A -> B -> A /\ B
```

#### Definition: or of two propositions

```coq
Inductive or (A B : Prop) : Prop :=
    or_introl : A -> A \/ B
  | or_intror : B -> A \/ B
```

type of or

```coq
or
     : Prop -> Prop -> Prop
```
type of or_introl

```coq
or_introl
     : forall A B : Prop, A -> A \/ B
```
type of or_intror
```coq
or_intror
     : forall A B : Prop, B -> A \/ B
```

Definition: not (A: Prop) : Prop :=  

not(False) is not "True", in the propositional world it is a function that takes False and gives False.

Statement1 :- 
forall A: Prop, A->not(not A)

Statement2 :-
forall A: Prop, not(not A) -> A

*not A is take proof of A and produce proof of False*
*A->B means take proof of A and produce proof of B*

Try out De-Morgans Law at home. (Try all 4 de-morgans law)
You will need one more tactic called "constructor" .
