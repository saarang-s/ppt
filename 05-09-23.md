- The only Idea we need to have is, if a term is an element of type.

- Prop stands for "proposition".

#### Gallina Language

- Calculus of Construction  + Inductive definition. CoIC.
- fun x:nat -> exp.

```
Inductive True: Prop := I : True
```
(1) A new Prop i screated called Tree.
(2) A constant I is created fo type True.

```
Inductive False: Prop := .
```

A type system (if you think of it as a logic) is inconsistent if every type as a inhabitant.

- The type system of Haskell is inconsistent.

- Let A be type
ida ; A-A => fun x;A

fix (f A-> A):A = f(fix f)

#### Inductive and 

```
Inductive and( A, B:Prop): Prop :=
    conj: A-> B -> A /\ B 
```

#### Inductive or
```
Inductive or (A,B: Prop): Or :=
    | or_introl : A -> or A B
    | or_intror : B -> or A B
```
